This is a website that I have created courtesy of TOP, it has taken me a while but finally am  beginning to get it.

I have utilized flex and flex box to manipulate the layout of the site. Before getting it right, phew, I must admit, it hasn't been a walk in the park,

Also full credit goes to Senior Living @ https://stocksnap.io/ for  providing such beautifull photos. 

Thankfully, TOP held my hand and I can confidently say am deeply honored.

As this is my very first website courtesy of TOP, I realized that I have a lot of learning to do. I have done my best for this particular one, and will be making it better as I progresses on.
